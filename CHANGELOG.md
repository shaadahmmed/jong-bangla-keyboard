# Changelog

Notable changes to Jong Bangla are recorded here. Detailed development steps and
validation evidence live in Git history and the [progress handoff](docs/progress.md).

## Unreleased

This is the initial development baseline, not a published release. The Cargo
package version `0.1.0` does not establish a release date or desktop support claim.

### Added

- Independent, dependency-free Rust phonetic transliteration with contextual
  vowels, consonants, conjuncts, case-sensitive spellings, symbols, escapes,
  reph and Bangla digits.
- Platform-independent composition with editable Bangla, raw-key Backspace,
  Ctrl+Backspace clearing, commit, cancel and reset.
- Experimental Linux Fcitx5 addon with a Rust C ABI, C++ adapter, isolated
  dispatcher harness and staged installation/removal checks.
- Reference fixtures and comparison tooling for a pinned jsAvroPhonetic revision,
  with separate cases for deliberate Unicode preservation differences.
- Core latency, adapter resource and lifecycle/leak measurement tooling.
- Focused typing, installation, development, reference and performance guides,
  contribution instructions, and issue/pull request templates.

### Behavior decisions

- Keep unsupported Unicode unchanged without lowercasing or normalization.
- Show converted Bangla without a Bangla/Latin choice list for v1.
- Escape commits active Bangla and consumes the press; Space and Enter commit
  before forwarding. Navigation and application shortcuts also commit first.
- Keep autocorrection and prediction outside the first release.

### Known limitations

- Compatibility checks cover a bounded set; full Avro parity is not established.
- Desktop evidence is limited to recorded environments. Actual installed-route
  typing and the broader frontend matrix still need confirmation.
- KWrite/Kate Bangla word-navigation and committed-word deletion issues remain
  deferred for v1. IBus and Windows integrations are future work.

See the [requirements](docs/v1.md) and [current handoff](docs/progress.md#current-position)
for exact decisions, environment evidence and next steps.
