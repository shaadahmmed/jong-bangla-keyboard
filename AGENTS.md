# Developer and agent guide

## Project

Jong Bangla (`jong-bangla-board`) is a Bangla phonetic desktop input method,
implemented from scratch with a reusable Rust engine. The first release targets
Fcitx5 on Linux, with CachyOS + KDE Plasma on Wayland as the first test environment.
IBus and Windows integrations are future work. Project code is MIT licensed.

`docs/v1.md` distinguishes confirmed requirements from proposals and open decisions.
Do not turn a proposal into a requirement without explaining the decision.
User instructions take precedence over this guide; update the docs when they change.

## Read project context efficiently

- Follow applicable `AGENTS.md` instructions; reuse instructions already supplied
  in the conversation instead of reading the same file again.
- At the start of a session, read only the
  [Current position](docs/progress.md#current-position),
  [Latest completed step](docs/progress.md#latest-completed-step), and
  [Next small implementation step](docs/progress.md#next-small-implementation-step)
  sections of the progress log for the current handoff.
- Use [README.md](README.md) for orientation and links to the focused guides.
  Read relevant sections of [docs/development.md](docs/development.md) for check
  commands, [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution expectations, and
  [docs/v1.md](docs/v1.md) for requirements and decisions needed by the task.
  Do not read these documents in full by default.
- Read historical progress entries only when investigating an earlier decision
  or regression, or when the current handoff lacks necessary context.
- Read affected code, related tests/fixtures, and check tooling as needed. Use
  targeted searches and line ranges instead of printing entire large files.
- Do not reread unchanged material already available in the conversation. After
  context compaction, recover only the sections needed to continue; reread when
  a file changes or necessary context is missing.
- Keep successful check output to a summary; inspect and show failure details
  when needed. Run all required checks without printing every passing fixture.
- Keep the current handoff accurate so routine work does not require reading
  the full history. These reading rules do not reduce validation requirements.

## Collaborate in coherent steps

- Explain the purpose and expected result of the next coherent step before editing.
- Complete one coherent, reviewable increment at a time. Avoid combining engine
  changes, platform integration, packaging, and unrelated cleanup in one change.
- For phonetic rule coverage, prefer the largest coherent batch of related
  conjuncts or spellings that can be independently reference-checked, validated,
  and reviewed together. Start by looking for 3–6 related spellings and expand
  when the behavior remains manageable; this is a planning guide, not a cap.
  Do not split straightforward related work merely to keep batches small.
- Define each batch's scope before editing. Check each spelling's exact Unicode,
  vowel/context behavior, following-`r` behavior, and overlapping matches against
  the pinned reference independently; shared output alone does not establish
  shared behavior. Include interactions between the selected spellings and
  existing rules. Split only when behavioral differences, unresolved reference
  results, or review complexity prevent a reliable coherent change.
- Share fixture/check tooling where useful while preserving independent expected
  outputs and evidence for every spelling. Use targeted reference checks during
  investigation, then one full required validation run, documentation/handoff
  update, and review summary for the completed batch. Commit only after the user's
  explicit confirmation. Repeat full checks when later edits or failures require
  them; do not repeat the full cycle for every spelling.
- Walk the user through the result in plain language: what changed, why it matters,
  how it was checked, and what comes next. Explain unfamiliar terms when introduced.
- Update the three handoff sections in `docs/progress.md` after each coherent
  step; replace their summaries rather than extending a cumulative narrative.
  Aim for 50–100 lines before the historical `Completed steps` section. Keep
  current state concise and point to coverage docs instead of listing every rule.
- In `Latest completed step`, record the date, result, actual check commands and
  outcomes, remaining limitations, and next action. Summarize successful checks;
  include failure details when they affect the handoff. Identify any older check
  results as prior evidence, not checks rerun in the current step.
- Preserve existing historical entries without routinely appending new ones.
  Use Git for detailed change history, `docs/v1.md` for requirements and behavioral
  decisions, and tests/fixtures for exact compatibility evidence. Reference a
  relevant existing commit when useful; do not try to embed a commit's own hash.
- Keep planned, in-progress, and completed work distinct. Never claim a check or
  milestone is complete without evidence.
- Implement every new feature and fix on a branch and submit it through a pull
  request to `main`; do not push these changes directly to `main`.
- Do not automatically commit completed work. Finish the checks and documentation,
  then give the user a detailed summary of changes, validation and limitations,
  propose a descriptive commit message, and wait for explicit confirmation before
  committing. Include only the reviewed step's work in the approved commit.
- Keep release versions manual and prepare them through a release pull request.
  Follow [the release guide](docs/releases.md); automation prepares drafts, while
  publication remains an explicit maintainer action.
- Continue within the requested scope without adding routine approval gates.
  Ask concise questions when an unresolved choice materially changes behavior.
- Keep documentation-only tasks to documentation. Do not scaffold an application
  or add dependencies just to make a documentation change look complete.
- Do not delegate to other agents unless the user explicitly requests it.

## Product behavior

- Aim for Avro-compatible phonetic behavior, using an independently implemented
  engine. Choose and document the compatibility reference before claiming parity.
- Keep the active word in preedit: text remains editable before it is committed
  to the application. Backspace removes a raw phonetic keystroke and recomputes it.
- Ctrl+Backspace clears the whole active raw buffer without committing; with no
  active buffer, let the application handle word deletion.
- Space and Enter commit active Bangla, then forward the same key to the application.
  Keep punctuation and phonetic escapes editable until an explicit boundary.
- For v1, show converted Bangla in editable preedit without a Bangla/Latin choice
  list or raw Latin selection. Revisit choices after the first release if needed.
- Convert digits to Bangla by default; digit keys enter text.
- Keep future autocorrection separate from deterministic transliteration. Do not
  silently change spelling, add dictionaries, or implement prediction for v1.
- Prioritize responsive typing and low resource use; verify performance claims.

## Architecture boundaries

- Keep transliteration independent of Fcitx5, display servers, desktop APIs, and UI.
- Keep composition state and edit/commit actions independent of the platform
  adapter so future IBus and Windows adapters can share behavior.
- Keep framework-specific key events, preedit updates, and commits in the adapter.
  Reuse Fcitx5 UI facilities where suitable.
- Rust is the implementation language for engine and composition logic. A minimal
  C++ bridge is a proposal to validate against Fcitx5's addon API, not a settled
  requirement. Do not move transliteration rules into a bridge.
- Add concrete extension points when needed. Do not build a dynamic plugin system
  or speculative IBus/Windows adapters for the first release.
- Keep unsafe code at a documented interoperability boundary when unavoidable.
  Specify ownership, lifetimes, encoding, error handling, and panic containment.

## Correctness and validation

- Store source and fixtures as UTF-8. Handle Rust strings at valid character
  boundaries; deleting a raw keystroke must not delete a byte from Bangla output.
- Add meaningful regression cases for phonetic rules and composition behavior:
  contextual vowels, conjuncts, case-sensitive sequences, punctuation/escape
  sequences, digits, Backspace, Ctrl+Backspace, boundary forwarding, commit,
  cancel, and reset.
- Track expected Unicode sequences and the source of compatibility fixtures.
  Visually similar output alone does not establish compatibility.
- Keep platform smoke tests separate from engine tests. Record actual distro,
  Plasma, Fcitx5, toolkit/application versions, and whether the app uses Wayland
  or XWayland. Do not describe an untested environment as supported.
- Once Rust code exists, use the repository's documented format, lint, and test
  commands. Until then, do not claim Cargo checks ran or invent setup commands.
- Run checks appropriate to the changed behavior and report checks that could
  not run. Documentation-only edits need link and consistency checks, not tests.
- Do not log or persist the user's typed text by default.

## Dependencies and documentation

- Prefer the latest stable development tools where practical. Verify current
  releases against official sources and record the versions actually used.
- Prefer small, justified dependencies. Keep per-keystroke processing local;
  typing must not depend on network access or a separate service.
- Write original project code under MIT. Check provenance and license obligations
  before introducing third-party source, rule tables, fixtures, or assets.
- Keep the README focused on the project introduction, status, quick start and
  links. Put detailed commands in the focused `docs/` guides; record notable
  user-facing changes under `Unreleased` in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Record behavioral decisions in `docs/v1.md`; update usage/build instructions
  alongside code. Explain tradeoffs without creating unnecessary documents.
- Never overwrite unrelated work or change system input-method settings as a
  side effect of development. Document installation separately from source edits.
