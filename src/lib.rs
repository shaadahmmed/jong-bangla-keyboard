//! Deterministic Bangla phonetic transliteration with no external dependencies.
//!
//! Converts supported phonetic sequences and ASCII digits, preserving unmatched
//! Unicode characters. A platform-independent composition controller supports
//! editable preedit and normalized editing keys. Compatibility with Avro is
//! partial. Experimental Fcitx5 event translation lives in a separate adapter;
//! desktop integration has limited manual smoke evidence and remains experimental.
//!
//! See the repository's [coverage overview] and [behavior notes] for supported
//! rules, compatibility evidence, and limitations.
