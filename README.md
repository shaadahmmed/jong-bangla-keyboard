# Jong Bangla

A Bangla phonetic desktop input method with an independently implemented Rust
engine. Type phonetic Latin keys and edit the converted Bangla before committing
it to your application.

The working project name is `jong-bangla-board`; **Jong Bangla** is the proposed
display name. The first release targets **Fcitx5 on Linux**, with **CachyOS + KDE
Plasma on Wayland** as the first test environment. IBus and Windows are future work.

## Project status

**Experimental and under development.** The Rust transliteration engine and
composition controller are implemented, and an experimental Fcitx5 addon builds
and passes isolated dispatcher tests. Limited desktop typing has been reported
in GTK3, Firefox, KWrite and Kate. Installation staging has been checked; actual
installed-route desktop typing still awaits confirmation.

The engine targets a [pinned jsAvroPhonetic reference](docs/v1.md#phonetic-behavior-reference).
Recorded evidence covers 522,933 parity cases plus separate Unicode policy cases;
this is bounded coverage, not a claim of full Avro compatibility. Unsupported
Unicode is preserved without lowercasing or normalization.

KWrite/Kate Bangla word-navigation and committed-word deletion issues are deferred
for v1. Broader application and Wayland/XWayland routes remain unverified. See the
[current handoff](docs/progress.md#current-position) for evidence and limitations.

## Typing behavior

- Keep the active word editable as converted Bangla.
- Backspace removes a phonetic keystroke and recomputes the word.
- Ctrl+Backspace clears the active word; with no active word, the application handles it.
- Space and Enter commit Bangla and forward the same key to the application.
- Punctuation and phonetic escapes stay editable until a commit boundary.
- Digit keys produce Bangla digits by default.
- Typing runs locally, without dictionaries, prediction or automatic spelling changes.

See the [typing guide](docs/typing.md) for examples and other controls.

## Try the engine

With Rust/Cargo **1.99.1 or newer**, run from the repository root:

```sh
cargo run --offline --example convert -- 'ami bangla'
```

Expected output: `আমি বাংলা`. This terminal example exercises conversion; the
desktop addon has separate prerequisites and installation steps.

To try the experimental desktop input method, follow the
[Fcitx5 installation guide](docs/installation.md). For building, testing and the
library layout, use the [development guide](docs/development.md).

## Contributing

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for bug reports, development checks and
pull request expectations. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains the detailed developer
and coding-agent workflow. Contributions should keep transliteration independent
of desktop frameworks and preserve exact Unicode evidence for phonetic changes.
