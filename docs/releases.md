# Releases

Jong Bangla uses branches and pull requests, manually selected versions, and
automated draft releases. The automation does not publish releases, merge PRs,
create version bumps or publish Cargo packages. Both crates remain `publish = false`.
Start with source releases while public binary packaging remains undecided.

## Everyday changes

1. Create a branch from an up-to-date `main` for each feature or fix. Use the same
   process for documentation and maintenance changes; keep each PR focused.
2. Add meaningful regression coverage, relevant docs and notable user-facing
   entries under `Unreleased` in [the changelog](../CHANGELOG.md).
3. Run the relevant [development checks](development.md). An assisting agent
   presents a detailed summary and waits for explicit user confirmation before
   committing; finishing a task does not authorize a commit.
4. Push the approved branch and open a PR to `main`. Inspect the actual hosted CI
   results before merging. Do not push features or fixes directly to `main`.

Use descriptive PR titles and labels: `enhancement`, `bug`, `breaking-change`,
`documentation` or `dependencies`. The [release-note configuration](../.github/release.yml)
groups merged PRs by these labels, with a catch-all for other changes.
`skip-release-notes` excludes an internal-only PR from generated notes; it does
not remove the change from the source archive or the full Git history.

## Version policy

Select versions manually in a release preparation PR. Keep the core and Fcitx5
addon at one project version for now, so one tag identifies the complete source.
Tags use `vX.Y.Z`, or `vX.Y.Z-alpha.N`, `vX.Y.Z-beta.N`, `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` with `N >= 1`.
The metadata version omits the leading `v`. Other tag forms are rejected.

- `alpha`: experimental releases with explicitly documented missing validation
  or known defects. `v0.1.0-alpha.1` is the suggested first public release, not a
  version selected or published by this setup change.
- `beta`: intended first-release features are implemented and installation and
  the intended desktop routes have recorded validation; remaining issues are
  listed for testers.
- `rc`: a candidate for a declared stable scope with no known blocking defects.
- Before `1.0`, use a new minor version for incompatible changes to the declared
  interface or behavior; use patch versions for compatible fixes.
- `1.0.0` requires a documented API/behavior promise, installation path and
  tested support scope. After that, use SemVer major/minor/patch rules.

These are project readiness conventions. They do not convert an untested
desktop route into supported behavior. See [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
The current Cargo `0.1.0` baseline is not a published release.

## Prepare a release PR

1. Create a release branch and select the next version. Update `version` in
   [the core manifest](../Cargo.toml) and [the FFI manifest](../adapters/fcitx5/ffi/Cargo.toml),
   and `Version` in [the addon metadata](../adapters/fcitx5/jong-bangla.conf.in).
   Regenerate `Cargo.lock` with `cargo generate-lockfile --offline`; inspect its diff.
2. Copy [the release template](../.github/RELEASE_TEMPLATE.md) into `CHANGELOG.md`
   below `Unreleased`. Replace all `{{...}}` placeholders, use an ISO date
   (`YYYY-MM-DD`), and move the changes being released into this dated section.
   Keep `Unreleased` available for future work. Do not duplicate its initial
   "not a published release" baseline description into published notes.
3. Fill every template section. Use `None` for no fixes/breaking changes. State
   desktop checks not performed for this release explicitly, and identify older
   observations as prior evidence. Carry forward applicable known issues,
   including the unresolved Brave/WhatsApp first-character loss unless resolved
   or explicitly deferred. A source release does not imply a desktop support claim.
4. Run the [documented checks](development.md), including the adapter's staged
   install check. Run the [pinned reference checks](reference-checks.md) for
   phonetic changes and the appropriate resource checks for new performance claims.
   Record real desktop results for the exact release candidate; CI covers
   synthetic tests, not GUI applications. After a changed candidate is merged,
   repeat any desktop checks needed for the final commit before tagging it.
5. Run the release validator using your selected version, for example:

   ```sh
   python3 tools/check-release.py v0.1.0-alpha.1
   ```

   The example intentionally fails against the unreleased initial baseline.
   It must pass for the prepared release version. The validator checks both
   manifests, both lockfile package versions, addon metadata, a unique dated
   changelog section, required nonempty note sections and unresolved placeholders.
6. Review the complete diff, get explicit user confirmation before an agent
   commits, then submit the release PR. Merge only after hosted checks pass.

## Tag and review the draft

Once the release PR is merged, fetch `origin/main`, identify the exact approved
release commit and rerun the version validator at that commit. Create an annotated
version tag pointing to that commit and push that tag explicitly. Do not tag
whatever happens to be the latest local branch commit or push unrelated tags.
Release tags are maintained by a human; a tag created using a workflow's default
`GITHUB_TOKEN` will not normally trigger another workflow.

The [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) runs on `v*` tag pushes:

1. Require the tagged commit to be an ancestor of `origin/main`, then validate
   metadata and release notes. This checks main-branch membership; GitHub branch
   rules enforce the PR-only requirement.
2. Run the same [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) against the tagged commit.
3. Create `jong-bangla-VERSION.tar.gz` from that commit with a matching
   `SHA256SUMS`, and prepare a GitHub **draft** with the reviewed changelog notes,
   a validation-run link and generated PR/contributor notes. Version suffixes
   automatically set the draft's prerelease flag; drafts are never marked latest.

Review the title, notes, prerequisite/install links, known issues, prerelease
flag and assets before manually publishing. For stable releases, deliberately
select whether it should be the latest release. Keep prereleases off latest.
Verify the downloaded archive with `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` in its download folder.
Checksums detect corrupted downloads; they are not a substitute for provenance.

Rerun a failed workflow at the same tag for transient build/network failures.
Existing releases are never overwritten by this workflow. If draft creation
partially succeeds, inspect it and finish or remove that unpublished draft before
retrying. If source or notes committed to the tag need changing, prepare a new
version through a PR. Never move/reuse a release tag or replace published assets.

## GitHub repository settings

Workflow files cannot enforce repository branch rules or enable immutable
releases. An administrator must configure these settings separately; this local
setup has not changed or verified the hosted settings.

- Add an active branch ruleset for `main` requiring a PR, blocking force pushes
  and deletion, and requiring the `Documentation and release tooling` and
  `Rust and Fcitx5` status checks. Select the actual checks after their first
  successful hosted run; require the branch to be up to date before merging.
- For a solo maintainer, require PRs with **zero required approving reviewers**:
  you cannot approve your own PR. Add a required independent reviewer when one
  is available. Avoid routine bypasses of the branch rules.
- Add a tag ruleset for `v*` blocking updates and deletion, while allowing
  maintainers to create new release tags.
- Enable immutable releases. Assemble all assets in the draft before publishing.
  Publication then locks the tag/assets; title and notes remain editable.
- Keep the default Actions token read-only. Only the release draft job requests
  `contents: write`; PR checks use no release credentials. External actions use
  full commit SHAs, with weekly Dependabot update PRs.
- Create the labels listed above and `skip-release-notes` if missing. Ensure
  GitHub Actions and Dependabot version updates are allowed for the repository.

CI uses an official rolling `archlinux:base-devel` container, upgrades it before
building, and records package versions in the job summary. This meets the
documented Fcitx5 prerequisite without claiming bit-for-bit reproducible builds
or a validated support matrix. Network access is used for tooling installation;
transliteration and Rust workspace checks remain local/offline.
